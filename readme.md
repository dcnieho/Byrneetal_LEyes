This repository contains the code for the various simulations and model training regimes, as well as the trained models and the code for evaluating the model on the various real image data sets used and developed for the article _[Byrne, S.A., Maquiling, V., Nyström, M., Kasneci, E., & Niehorster, D.C. (submitted). LEyes: A Lightweight Framework for Deep Learning-Based Eye Tracking using Synthetic Eye Images.](url_to_come)_

Contents:
- `model_training`: this folder contains the code for generating the various simulations used in the paper, as well as the code for training our models on these simulations.
- `trained_model`: this folder contains the trained models used for the evaluations reported in Byrne et al. (submitted).
- `eval`: this folder contains the code for running the model evaluations on real eye images (note that the high resolution set is not publicly available).
- `results_EDS2020`: this folder contains images showing our model performance on all 2605 annotated images from the [EDS2020](https://doi.org/10.3390%2Fs21144769) dataset.
- `datasets`: If you wish to run the `eval` folder, acquire the needed dataset and place it in a subfolder here.
